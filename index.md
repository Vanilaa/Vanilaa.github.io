# Welcome to Dashboard Decor Webpage

This project is managed by Yaqi (yg298) and Alina (lw584) during Fall 2023 and demonstrate on 12/7/2023.

In this project, we want to make our home or study area more comfortable, creating this safe space where we would love to study or live in, therefore we came up with the idea of creating a desktop gadget. We envision this to be a versatile, fun, and aesthetic decor for someone who is into Pixel art. This dashboard will combine different functionalities like controlling Spotify song playback, playing drawing and guessing game, entering Zen mode with weather forecast, and displaying cute animations
