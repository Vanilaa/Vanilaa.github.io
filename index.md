In this project, we want to make our home or study area more comfortable, creating this safe space where we would love to study or live in, therefore we came up with the idea of creating a desktop gadget. We envision this to be a versatile, fun, and aesthetic decor for someone who is into Pixel art. This dashboard will combine different functionalities like controlling Spotify song playback, playing drawing and guessing game, entering Zen mode with weather forecast, and displaying cute animations
